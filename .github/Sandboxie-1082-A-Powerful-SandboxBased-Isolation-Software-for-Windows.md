Sandboxie 10.82 is the latest version of the software, which supports Windows 7 and later, both 32-bit and 64-bit. It also supports ARM64 architecture, which is becoming more popular in devices such as laptops and tablets. Sandboxie 10.82 comes in two flavors: Classic and Plus. The Classic version has a MFC-based user interface, while the Plus version has a Qt-based user interface with new features and options.
 
One of the main advantages of Sandboxie 10.82 is that it allows you to run multiple sandboxes simultaneously, each with its own settings and applications. You can also create templates for common sandbox configurations, such as web browsers, email clients, or office suites. You can also customize the sandbox behavior, such as file access, network access, resource access, and more.
 
To use Sandboxie 10.82, you need to download and install the software from its official website or GitHub repository. You also need to activate it with a keygen serial key, which you can generate using a keygen program. A keygen program is a software that creates valid license keys for a given software. However, be careful when using keygen programs, as they may contain malware or viruses that can harm your system.
 
If you are looking for a reliable and versatile sandbox-based isolation software for Windows, you should give Sandboxie 10.82 a try. It is a powerful and flexible tool that can protect your system from unwanted changes and threats.
  
## How to Run Applications in a Sandbox With Sandboxie 10.82
 
Once you have created and configured your sandbox, you can start using it to run applications in isolation. There are several ways to do that with Sandboxie 10.82:
 
- Right-click on a file you'd like to open in your newly set up sandbox. If on Windows 11, this is the point where you'll have to choose the Show more options entry from the menu that shows up. Then, select the option that up to Windows 10 is directly available without that step: Run Sandboxed. You will see a list of your available sandboxes. Choose the one you want to use and click OK. The file will open in the sandboxed application associated with it.
- Right-click on an application shortcut or executable file and choose Run Sandboxed from the context menu. Again, select the sandbox you want to use and click OK. The application will launch in the sandbox.
- Drag and drop a file or an application shortcut onto a sandbox in Sandboxie Plus' main window. The file or application will run in that sandbox.
- Use the Run Any Program command in the Sandbox menu of Sandboxie Plus. You can browse for a file or an application to run in a sandbox of your choice.
- Use the Run Web Browser command in the Sandbox menu of Sandboxie Plus. You can choose from a list of installed web browsers to run in a sandbox of your choice.

You can tell if an application is running in a sandbox by looking at its window title or border. By default, Sandboxie 10.82 adds [#] at the end of the window title and changes the border color to yellow. You can customize these settings in Sandbox Options > Appearance.
